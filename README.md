## Tell me about your Project

In my previous role, I developed the backend for a real-time multiplayer game using .NET Core. We used a microservices architecture to handle key features like player matchmaking, real-time communication, and leaderboards. For real-time gameplay, I integrated SignalR to manage WebSocket connections, allowing players to communicate their moves instantly.
     
We stored player profiles and game data in SQL Server while using Redis for caching active game sessions and leaderboards. The system was deployed on Azure with Kubernetes, allowing it to scale dynamically based on player demand. This ensured low-latency gameplay for over 1 million players.
     
For security, we used JWT tokens for player authentication, ensuring secure and stateless communication between the client and server.

## Architecture of a Multiplayer Game Backend:
    
Client-Server Model: The client (game app) communicates with the server (backend) for operations like player registration, authentication, game state synchronization, and matchmaking. The server is responsible for managing game logic, player connections, and real-time communication.    
Microservices Architecture: .NET Core supports building modular systems where game functionalities like matchmaking, leaderboards, and player stats are managed in separate services. This architecture enhances scalability and maintainability.

## Real-Time Communication with SignalR:

For multiplayer games, real-time communication between the server and players is crucial. SignalR is a library built into ASP.NET Core that allows real-time communication via WebSockets or other protocols.    

Use Case: It is used to broadcast messages to all players (like game state updates) or send targeted messages (like player-specific notifications or movements).    
Example: In a multiplayer game where players need to synchronize actions (e.g., shooting, moving), SignalR helps keep all clients in sync    

```csharp
public class GameHub : Hub
{
    public async Task SendMove(string player, string move)
    {
        // Broadcast the player's move to all other connected players
        await Clients.Others.SendAsync("ReceiveMove", player, move);
    }
}
```

#### 1). CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that allows or restricts web applications running at one domain to make requests for resources from a different domain.  
- In a .NET Core API, CORS is implemented using middleware.   
- A CORS policy defines which domains, HTTP methods, headers, and other options are permitted. 
- You need to register the CORS middleware in the Configure method of Startup.cs .
  
```csharp
app.UseCors("AllowSpecificOrigin");
```

#### 9). Extension Methods - App.Run() and App.Use()

Extension methods are a way to add new functionality to existing types without modifying their source code. They are static methods that can be called as if they are instance methods on the extended type.

In one of my .NET Core projects, I created an extension method for validating email addresses. 

```csharp
public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static bool IsValidEmail(this string email)
    {
        return Regex.IsMatch(email, @"^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$");
    }
}
```

üéÆ In a game server using .NET, app.Run is typically part of the setup in an ASP.NET Core application, where it starts the web host and begins listening for incoming HTTP requests. For a backend game server, especially in Unity or another game framework using .NET Core, app.Run is used to host the game server logic via a web API or WebSocket server.

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might use app.Run in a game server setup for handling player connections or game events via HTTP or WebSockets:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services like WebSockets or other game-related services
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddWebSocketManager(); // If using WebSockets for real-time interactions

var app = builder.Build();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}

app.UseRouting();

// If using WebSockets
app.UseWebSockets();

// Endpoints for HTTP-based requests
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllers();  // Map API routes for game functionality
});

// Run the game server
app.Run();
```

**app.UseRouting():** This is used to route incoming requests to the appropriate handlers (e.g., player connections, game events).
**app.UseWebSockets():** If you are handling real-time communication, WebSockets may be necessary for live multiplayer game servers.
**app.UseEndpoints():** Configures endpoints for different routes like /api/game/start for starting a game or /api/game/player/connect for player connections.    

In a multiplayer backend, app.Run effectively starts the game server, enabling it to handle player requests, game events, matchmaking, or real-time communication over WebSockets.

#### 10.2). DataBase First Approach and CodeFirst Approach

- [Entity Framework Core Model](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore5.com/entity-framework-core-model)

üéÆ Store persistent player data (e.g., profiles, achievements, leaderboards) using a database like SQL Server. Use Entity Framework Core (Code First) to interact with the database.

#### 10.2). SQL and NoSQL

üéÆ Multiplayer games often have global leaderboards. .NET Core can integrate with databases like Redis for fast leaderboard lookups and use SQL or NoSQL databases to store player performance stats.

```csharp
public class LeaderboardService
{
    private readonly IRedisCache _redis;

    public LeaderboardService(IRedisCache redis)
    {
        _redis = redis;
    }

    public async Task<IEnumerable<Player>> GetTopPlayers()
    {
        // Get top players from Redis cache
        return await _redis.GetTopPlayersAsync();
    }
}
```
**Performance Optimization:    
Asynchronous Programming:** Use async/await patterns to handle concurrent connections and I/O-bound operations, which is crucial in multiplayer games to prevent blocking threads.  
**Caching:** Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data, like player profiles or game states, to reduce database load.

- [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID in simple terms](https://medium.com/@iamprovidence/oauth-2-0-and-openid-in-simple-terms-7196089a1b29)

üéÆ In a multiplayer game, it‚Äôs important to authenticate users securely. .NET Core provides Identity and OAuth2.0 for managing player authentication and authorization.

**JWT Tokens:** Issue JWT tokens for player authentication. This is particularly useful in games, where the token can be passed in each request to verify the player‚Äôs identity without maintaining a session.

```csharp
public class AuthController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ITokenService _tokenService;

    public AuthController(ITokenService tokenService)
    {
        _tokenService = tokenService;
    }

    [HttpPost("login")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginDto loginDto)
    {
        var token = await _tokenService.GenerateJwtToken(loginDto);
        return Ok(new { token });
    }
}
```

Use JWT Tokens for player authentication, especially in multiplayer environments where players need to remain authenticated across multiple sessions.

üíª **Explain how you Implement Authentication and Authorization in a Project:**         
**Authentication Example:** "In one of my projects, I used ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication. We allowed users to sign in using either their email and password or via Google using OAuth 2.0. For the web API, we implemented JWT tokens to authenticate users, where the token was validated with every API request."    

**Authorization Example:** "For authorization, we implemented a role-based system where different user roles had different access levels. For example, Admin users could manage products, while regular users could only view them. We used the [Authorize] attribute in ASP.NET Core to protect specific API endpoints and ensured the users' roles were checked before performing certain actions."

#### 14). Session Management

**Sessions** in Web Applications refer to the mechanism of storing user-specific data temporarily on the server side across multiple requests. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the client side, session data is stored on the server side, enhancing security and reducing the risk of exposing sensitive information.
Sessions typically generate a unique identifier (session ID) for each user session upon their first interaction with the application. This identifier (session ID) is stored as a cookie on the client side (usually), and the corresponding data is stored on the Web Server. When the client makes subsequent requests, this session ID is sent in the Request header. The server uses this identifier to retrieve session-specific data stored in memory (Temporary Caching Mechanism), a database, or another persistent storage mechanism. This data persists until the session expires (due to user inactivity or logout) or is manually cleared.
